# KZG polynomial commitments exploration

This repository is an exploration to KZG (Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg) polynomial commitments. The goal is to explore the topic and document every progress in this README. The target would be to have a CLI that allows to handle the different steps in order to perform a polynomial commitment.

The codebase will be written in Rust. As I'm still learning things about Rust, this README will also contain some documentation about my learning in Rust.

## Starting point

- I have a good understanding of modular arithmetics but I am not a mathematician. I understand elliptic curve basic theory but I never got my hands dirty on it yet (theoretically or in software),
- I have followed the lectures of the [Applied ZK learning group of 0xParc](https://learn.0xparc.org/materials/circom/learning-group-1/intro-zkp/).

## Exploration steps

Need to start somewhere.
